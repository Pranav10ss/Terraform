# AWS VPC Landing Zone
## Project description:
An AWS Landing-Zone is a secure, standardized environment within your AWS account that serves as a foundation for deploying workloads and applications. It's like a pre-configured staging area with guardrails in place.
## Why do we need to use a Landing zone?
1. **Standardization and best practices**: Landing zone enforces best practices for security, access control, networking and
   logging.
   This consistancy makes managing your resources easier and it reduces the errors as well.
2. Security baseline: Landing zone establishes a baseline security for your account. This includes features like IAM policy,
   logging, configurations and VPC settings to keep your resources secured.
3. Organization and scalability: A landing zone can help you organize resources logically. This makes it easier for you to find
   manage your resources as it keeps growing.
